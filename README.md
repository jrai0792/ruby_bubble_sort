# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort

> The aim of this project is to implement the bubble sort algorithm. Assignment is focused on the use of yield and passing a block to a method.

In the #bubble_sort_by method, the yield is used inside the method definition to accomplish sorting. The block has two arguments that represent the two elements of the array that are currently being compared. The block’s return will be similar to the spaceship operator: If the result of the block execution is negative, the element on the left is “smaller” than the element on the right. 0 means both elements are equal. A positive result means the left element is greater. The block’s return value is used to sort the array.
